n the last Chapter, we came to know many compounds of importance 
to us. In this Chapter we will be studying about some more interesting 
compounds and their properties. Also we shall be learning about carbon, 
an element which is of immense significance to us in both its elemental 
form and in the combined form.

Look at the items that come in the last column – your teacher will be 
able to tell you that most of them are made up of compounds of carbon. 
Can you think of a method to test this? What would be the product if a 
compound containing carbon is burnt? Do you know of any test to 
confirm this? 

Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed 
are all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living 
structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s 
crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only 
0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-
carbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon 
dioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the 
importance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will be 
looking at the properties of carbon which lead to this anomaly. 

4.1 BONDING IN CARBON – THE COVALENT BOND 
In the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic 
compounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling 
points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also 


saw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these 
properties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds. 
Melting and boiling points of some carbon compounds are given in 
Table 4.1. 

Most carbon compounds are poor Table 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some 
conductors of electricity as we have seen compounds of carbon 
in Chapter 2. From the data on the 
boiling and melting points of the above 
compounds, we can conclude that the

does not give rise to any ions. 4

In Class IX, we learnt about the 
combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the 
number of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic 
configuration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would 
be the distribution of electrons in various shells for carbon? How many 
valence electrons will carbon have? 

We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency 
to attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas 
configuration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either 
gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon, 
it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four 
electrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose 
electrons – 

(i) It could gain four electrons forming C4– anion. But it would be difficult 
for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, 
four extra electrons. 
(ii) It could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require 
a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a 
carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two 
electrons. 
Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with 
other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon, 
but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this 
manner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outer shells of both the 
atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. 
Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple 
molecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons. 

The simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen. 
As you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence 
hydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron 
to fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a 
molecule of hydrogen, H2. This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the

electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, 
helium, which has two electrons in its K shell. We can 
depict this using dots or crosses to represent valence 
electrons (Fig. 4.1). 

The shared pair of electrons is said to constitute a 
single bond between the two hydrogen atoms. A single 
bond is also represented by a line between the two 
atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2. 

The atomic number of chlorine is 17. What would be its electronic 
configuration and its valency? Chlorine forms a diatomic molecule, Cl2. 
Can you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule? Note that 
only the valence shell electrons need to be depicted. 

In the case of oxygen, we see the formation of a double bond between 
two oxygen atoms. This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons 
in its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two 
more electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two 
electrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in 
Fig. 4.3. The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to 
two shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a double bond 
between the two atoms. 


Can you now depict a molecule of water showing the nature 
of bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen 
atoms? Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds? 


What would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of 
nitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. What would be 
its electronic configuration and its combining capacity? In 
order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of 
nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared 
pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond 
between the two atoms. The electron dot structure of N2 and 
its triple bond can be depicted as in Fig. 4.4. 


A molecule of ammonia has the formula NH3. Can you draw 
the electron dot structure for this molecule showing how all 

four atoms achieve noble gas configuration? Will the molecule 
have single, double or triple bonds? 

Let us now take a look at methane, which is a compound 
of carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major 
component of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It 
is also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon. 
Methane has a formula CH4. Hydrogen, as you know, has a 
valency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence 
electrons. In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon 
shares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown 
in Fig. 4.5. 
Such bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair 


between two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded 

molecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter


molecular forces are small. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling

These two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different 
physical properties even though their chemical properties are the same. Diamond is 
the hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. Graphite is also 
a very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the 
previous Chapter. 
Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and 
temperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable 
from natural diamonds. 
Fullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was 
C-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked 
like the geodesic dome designed by the US architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule 
was named fullerene.

are generally poor conductors of electricity. 
Allotropes of carbon 
The element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with 
widely varying physical properties. Both diamond and 
graphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in 
the manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one 
another. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four 
other carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional 
structure. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three 
other carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array. 
One of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of 
carbon is satisfied. Graphite structure is formed by the 
hexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other.

4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON 
We have seen the formation of covalent bonds by the sharing of 
electrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the 
structure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning 
of the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In 
fact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers 
of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was 
recently estimated to be about three million! This outnumbers by a 
large margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put 
together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other 
element? The nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a 
large number of compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of 
carbon are – 

(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of 
carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called 
catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon, 
branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. 
In addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple 
bonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single 
bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds. 
Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their 
carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds. 
No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent 
seen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with 
hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these 
compounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong 
and hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds 
with many carbon atoms linked to each other. 

(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with 
four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent 
element. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen, 
nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to 
compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements 
other than carbon present in the molecule. 
Again the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are 
very strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One 
reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size. 
This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons 
strongly. The bonds formed by elements having larger atoms are 
much weaker.

Organic compounds 
The two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put 
together give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same non-carbon 
atom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were 
initially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon 
compounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is, 
it was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler 
disproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon 
compounds, except for oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts continue 
to be studied under organic chemistry.

We have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound 
formed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C2H6. 
In order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon 
compounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms 
together with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the 
hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon 
(Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived 
in the following steps – 

C—C Step 1 

Figure 4.6 (a) Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond 

Three valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied, 
so each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving: 


Step 2

The electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c). 

Can you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular C—C 
formula C3H8 in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all 
the atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon 
compounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are 
normally not very reactive. 

However, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula 
C2H4 and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow 
the same step-wise approach as above. 


Each carbon atom gets two hydrogen atoms to give – 

We see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied. This 
can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the two carbons 
giving us –

The electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig. 4.7. 
Yet another compound of hydrogen and carbon has the formula 
C2H2 and is called ethyne. Can you draw the electron dot 
structure for ethyne? How many bonds are necessary between 
the two carbon atoms in order to satisfy their valencies? Such 
compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between 
the carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds 
and they are more reactive than the saturated carbon 
compounds.

4.2.2 Chains, Branches and Rings 
In the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane, 
ethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms. 
Such ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain tens of carbon atoms. The 
names and structures of six of these are given in Table 4.2.

But, let us take another look at butane. If we make the carbon 
‘skeleton’ with four carbon atoms, we see that two different ‘skeletons’ 
are possible – 

C—C—C—C 


Figure 4.8 (a) Two possible carbon-skeletons 

Filling the remaining valencies with hydrogen gives us – 


Figure 4.8 (b) Complete molecules for two structures with formula C4H10 

We see that both these structures have the same formula C4H10. Such 
compounds with identical molecular formula but different structures 
are called structural isomers. 

In addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds 
have carbon atoms arranged in the form of a ring. For example, cyclohexane 
has the formula C6H12 and the following structure –

Figure 4.9 Structure of cyclohexane (a) carbon skeleton (b) complete molecule 
Can you draw the electron dot structure for cyclohexane? Straight 
chain, branched chain and cyclic carbon compounds, all may be saturated 
or unsaturated. For example, benzene, C6H6, has the following structure – 


Benzene — C6H6 

Figure 4.10 Structure of benzene 

All these carbon compounds which contain just carbon and hydrogen 
are called hydrocarbons. Among these, the saturated hydrocarbons are 
called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or 
more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing one or more 
triple bonds are called alkynes. 

4.2.3 Will you be my Friend? 
Carbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking 
at compounds of carbon and hydrogen. But carbon also forms bonds

with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. In 
a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these 
elements, such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied. In such 
compounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a

heteroatom. These 
heteroatoms confer 
specific properties to the 
compound, regardless 
of the length and nature 
of the carbon chain and 
hence are called 
functional groups. 
Some important 
functional groups are 
given in the Table 4.3. 
Free valency or 
valencies of the group 
are shown by the single 
line. The functional 
group is attached to the 
carbon chain through 
this valency by 
replacing one hydrogen 
atom or atoms. 

4.2.4 Homologous Series 
You have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains 
of varying lengths. In addition, hydrogen atom or atoms on these carbon 
chains can be replaced by any of the functional groups that we saw 
above. The presence of a functional group such as alcohol dictates the 
properties of the carbon compound, regardless of the length of the carbon 
chain. For example, the chemical properties of CHOH, CHOH, CHOH

32537

and C4H9OH are all very similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in 
which the same functional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon 
chain is called a homologous series. 

Let us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table 

4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say – 
CH and CH— these differ by a –CH- unit
426 2

CH and CH— these differ by a –CH- unit

2638 2

What is the difference between the next pair – propane and butane (C4H10)? 

Can you find out the difference in molecular masses between these 
pairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen 
is 1 u)? 

Similarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member 
of the series is ethene which we have already come across in 
Section 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members 
have the formula CH, CH and CH. Do these also differ by a –CH– 

36485102 

66 
Science 


unit? Do you see any relation between the number of carbon and 
hydrogen atoms in these compounds? The general formula for alkenes 
can be written as CnH2n, where n = 2, 3, 4. Can you similarly generate the 
general formula for alkanes and alkynes? 

As the molecular mass increases in any homologous series, a 
gradation in physical properties is seen. This is because the melting 
points and boiling points increase with increasing molecular mass. Other 
physical properties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show 
a similar gradation. But the chemical properties, which are determined 
solely by the functional group, remain similar in a homologous series.

4.2.5 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds 
The names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name 
of the basic carbon chain modified by a “prefix” “phrase before” or “suffix” 
“phrase after” indicating the nature of the functional group. For example, 
the names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol, 
propanol and butanol. 
Naming a carbon compound can be done by the following method – 

(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A 
compound having three carbon atoms would have the name 
propane. 
(ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the 
name of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given 
in Table 4.4). 
(iii) If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, the 
name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and 
adding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain 
with a ketone group would be named in the following manner – 
Propane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone. 
(iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name 
of the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in 
Table 4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond 
would be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be 
called propyne.

Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while 
unsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of 
black smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on the metal plate in Activity 

4.3. However, limiting the supply of air results in incomplete combustion 
of even saturated hydrocarbons giving a sooty flame. The gas/kerosene 
stove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich 
Carbon and its Compounds

mixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of 
cooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked 
and fuel is getting wasted. Fuels such as coal and petroleum have some 
amount of nitrogen and sulphur in them. Their combustion results in 
the formation of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which are major 
pollutants in the environment. 

Do You Know? 
Why do substances burn with or without a flame? 
Have you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a 
chance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You 
have seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However, 
you will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and 
gives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous 
substances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present 
vapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning. 
A luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and 
start to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of 
that element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its 
colour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On 
this basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to? 
Formation of coal and petroleum 
Coal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to 
various biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and 
other plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth, 
perhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of 
earth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions 
of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to 
the sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning 
them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. 
Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the 
porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why 
coal and petroleum are called fossil fuels?

You have learnt

compounds can be easily

addition to this complete 
oxidation, we have reactions 
in which alcohols are 
converted to carboxylic 
acids – 

70 
Science 


We see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others. 
These substances are known as oxidising agents. 

Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate 
are oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting 
material. Hence they are known as oxidising agents. 

4.3.3 Addition Reaction 
Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts 
such as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts 
are substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different 
rate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly 
used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst. 
VegeTable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while 
animal fats have saturated carbon chains. 


You must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils 
are ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which 
are said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids 
should be chosen for cooking. 

4.3.4 Substitution Reaction 
Saturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence 
of most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added 
to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen 
atoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type 
of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of 
products are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.

4.4 SOME IMPORTANT CARBON COMPOUNDS – ETHANOL 
AND ETHANOIC ACID 
Many carbon compounds are invaluable to us. But here we shall study 
the properties of two commercially important compounds – ethanol and 
ethanoic acid. 

Carbon and its Compounds 

71 

4.4.1 Properties of Ethanol 
Ethanol is a liquid at room temperature (refer to Table 4.1 for the melting 
and boiling points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and 
is the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a 
good solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough 
syrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all 
proportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes 
drunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially 
widespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure 
ethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term 
consumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.

other substances produce hydrogen on reacting with

• 
What do you observe? 
• 
How will you test the gas evolved? metals? 
(ii) Reaction to give unsaturated hydrocarbon: Heating ethanol at 
443 K with excess concentrated sulphuric acid results in the 
dehydration of ethanol to give ethene – 
The concentrated sulphuric acid can be regarded as a dehydrating 
agent which removes water from ethanol. 

How do alcohols affect living beings? 
When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes 
and to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination, 
mental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupour. 
The individual may feel relaxed but does not realise that his sense of judgement, 
sense of timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired. 
Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol 
is oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of 
cells. It causes the protoplasm to get coagulated, in much the same way an egg is 
coagulated by cooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness. 
Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced 
for industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances 
like methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be 
identified easily. This is called denatured alcohol.

4.4.2 Properties of Ethanoic Acid 
Ethanoic acid is commonly called acetic acid and 
belongs to a group of acids called carboxylic 
acids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid in water is 
called vinegar and is used widely as a preservative 
in pickles. The melting point of pure ethanoic acid 
is 290 K and hence it often freezes during winter 
in cold climates. This gave rise to its name glacial 
acetic acid. 
The group of organic compounds called 
carboxylic acids are obviously characterised by a 
special acidity. However, unlike mineral acids like 
HCl, which are completely ionised, carboxylic 
acids are weak acids. 
Activity 4.7 
.. Compare the pH of dilute acetic acid 
and dilute hydrochloric acid using 
both litmus paper and universal 
indicator. 
.. Are both acids indicated by the 
litmus test? 
.. Does the universal indicator show 
them as equally strong acids? 
Activity 4.8 
.. Take 1 mL ethanol (absolute alcohol) 
and 1 mL glacial acetic acid along 
with a few drops of concentrated 
sulphuric acid in a test tube. 
.. Warm in a water-bath for at least five 
minutes as shown in Fig. 4.11. 
.. Pour into a beaker containing 
20-50 mL of water and smell the 
resulting mixture. 
Reactions of ethanoic acid: 
(i) Esterification reaction: Esters are most commonly 
formed by reaction of an acid and an alcohol. 
Ethanoic acid reacts with absolute ethanol in the 
presence of an acid catalyst to give an ester – 
Esters are sweet-smelling substances. These are used in making 
perfumes and as flavouring agents. Esters react in the presence of 
an acid or a base to give back the alcohol and carboxylic acid. This 
reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the 
preparation of soap. 
Figure 4.11 
Formation of ester 
Alcohol as a fuel 
Sugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical 
energy. Sugarcane juice can be used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give 
alcohol (ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a 
cleaner fuel which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient 
air (oxygen).

(ii) Reaction with a base: Like mineral acids, ethanoic acid reacts with 
a base such as sodium hydroxide to give a salt (sodium ethanoate 
or commonly called sodium acetate) and water: 
NaOH + CH3COOH . CH3COONa + H2O 

How does ethanoic acid react with carbonates and 
hydrogencarbonates?

Science 


This activity demonstrates the effect of soap in cleaning. Most dirt is 
oily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The 
molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic 
acids. The ionic-end of soap dissolves in water while the carbon chain 
dissolves in oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called micelles 
(see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet 
while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in water. The 
soap micelle thus helps in dissolving the dirt in water and we can wash 
our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13). 

Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if 
you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon? 

Micelles 
Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic, 
that is, it dissolves in water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it dissolves in 
hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap will 
not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the 
ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water, 
these molecules have a unique orientation that keeps 
the hydrocarbon portion out of the water. This is 
achieved by forming clusters of molecules in which 
the hydrophobic tails are in the interior of the cluster 
and the ionic ends are on the surface of the cluster. 
This formation is called a micelle. Soap in the form of 
a micelle is able to clean, since the oily dirt will be 
collected in the centre of the micelle. The micelles stay 
in solution as a colloid and will not come together to 
precipitate because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the 
dirt suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed 
away. The soap micelles are large enough to scatter 
light. Hence a soap solution appears cloudy.

solution to the other. 
• 
Shake both test tubes for the same period. 
• 
Do both test tubes have the same amount of foam? 
• 
In which test tube is a curdy solid formed? 
Have you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with 
difficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with 
water? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and 
magnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need 
to use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using 
another class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents. 
Detergents are generally ammonium or sulphonate salts of long chain 
carboxylic acids. The charged ends of these compounds do not form 
insoluble precipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard 
water. Thus, they remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually 
used to make shampoos and products for cleaning clothes.
